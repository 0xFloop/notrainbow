i built what i think is a cooler front end for rainbow.me :)

most of the site is styled exactly the same

i really just did this to push myself and practice web dev shit 

i think every website should tell a story

the site can be found at notrainbow.xyz

site is definitely NOT optimized for mobile btw

added features thus far:
-dark mode
-animations
-better display of the features rainbow wallet has to offer
-a quick explanation of what rainbow is on the homepage because there was no info there previously and the average user has a miniscule attention span and does not want to go to docs to understand things

cool potential updates:
-live price updates on phone displays
